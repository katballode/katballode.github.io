    <h1>New Beehive Inn</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The New Beehive Inn (for a period in the 1980s known as The Bradfordian) is a former pub in Bradford, England. It was built by Bradford Corporation (the local authority) in 1901 to replace an existing public house of the same name that they had purchased in 1889 and demolished to widen a road. The corporation intended to run the pub itself but instead let it out and sold it in 1926. It has since been run by a number of brewery companies and individuals. The pub contained many features dating to its construction and a significant refurbishment in 1936 and was described by the Campaign for Real Ale as "one of the country's very best historic pub interiors".
    </p>
    <p>
        The pub closed in 2022 and was sold that year. The bar was removed and the original windows were replaced with uPVC. The structure was granted protection as a grade II listed building by Historic England on 13 July 2022. The owners have subsequently applied to convert the pub into offices.

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The three-storey building is stone built with a slate roof and faces onto the B6144 road (Westgate). It is double fronted, with the symmetrical façade consisting of a narrow central bay (flanked by a wider bay on both sides, topped by elaborate gables. The outer bays contain recessed bow sash windows on the ground floor, with stone mullions. A double stringcourse separates each storey, with the uppermost containing a stone panel showing the construction date of 1901. Gold lettering on this stringcourse gives the pub name. The double front doors are wooden; a glazed semi-circular pub sign extends out above the door and above this is a large lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
        The side elevations are plainer with the walls painted with signage. The rear is also plain with standard gables and no string courses. A one-storey extension, housing a kitchen, extends from the left (south-east) elevation, and another, an extension to
 the music room, extends from the left hand part of the rear elevation.
 <p>
    <h2><b>Interior</b></h2>
</p>
<p>
    The ground floor revolves around a lobby that runs from the front to the rear. There are two main rooms on either side of the lobby. The lobby is also used as a bar where drinks can be ordered through a hatch that opens to the tap room on the right. The tap room is set up as a saloon bar with leather bench seats along the walls and a fireplace with a segmental arch surround. The floor is made of terrazzo tiles and the walls are covered with Lincrusta. An archway where the bar once stood leads to the music room, which is unremarkable.
</p>
<p>
    To the left of the lobby, the front room is known as the commercial room. It has wooden flooring, leather seating along the walls, and bell pushes for waiter service. The east wall holds a cast-iron fireplace. The rear room is known as the pink room. It has leather seats separated into booths by wood and glass partitions, more bell pushes, and a cast-iron register grate fireplace in a marble surround.
</p>
<p>
    The ladies' toilet is accessible from the rear of the lobby, and a tiled corridor connects the tap room and music room to the gentlemen's toilet. A wood and terrazzo-floored hall at the rear of the lobby connects to the rear and music room and houses the stairway. The upper floors have a similar layout to the ground floor but lack any remarkable features. A cellar was originally located beneath the tap room and was later extended southeast. The ground floor still has gas lighting.
</p>
<h6>History</h6>
<hr>
<p>
    There is sometimes an erroneous connection made to the Beehive Inn further down Westgate, but it was unrelated and was located on a different site until it was demolished in the 1860s. The New Beehive Inn replaced a nearby pub of the same name. Bradford Corporation purchased the pub and other properties from John Leach in 1889 and continued to lease it to Samuel Allsopp & Sons. The pub was demolished as part of a Westgate widening project.
</p>
<p>
    The current building was designed by Bradford City Surveyor JH Cox in April 1900 and was built in 1901. The original layout had a kitchen where the music room is now, and a smoking room where the pink room is now. The first floor had a music room and billiard rooms. The tap room was divided into a ladies room by a partition and operated as a traditional bar, while the other rooms had waiter service using the bell pushes.
</p>
<p>
    The pub originally held a beerhouse license (under the Beerhouse Act 1830) and only sold beer. The corporation originally intended to run the pub itself, but instead leased it to James Anthony Geoghegan, whose family managed the pub until 1926. The pub upgraded to a full alcohol license in 1906 by paying a fee of £1,500. The freehold was sold to William Whitaker & Co in 1926, and a Mr. Smith was appointed as manager and held the position until 1957. William Whitaker & Co refurbished the pub in 1936, giving it its current layout. The pub was purchased by Joshua Tetley & Son in 1959 and then by Trough Brewery in 1982, who renamed it The Bradfordian and operated it as a freehouse. In the 1980s, the interior was refurbished by Ray Buck with gas lighting and more bell pushes installed. The pub was purchased by William Wagstaff in 1989 and under his ownership reverted to The New Beehive Inn, he excavated the extension to the cellar, using the space to host music events. 
        Wagstaff also extended the kitchen and installed the glazed signage above the door. At some point a bed and breakfast was operated from the premises.
        The pub was listed by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) one of 119 Yorkshire Real Heritage Pubs in 2011 and it was featured in that organisation's 
        National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors as a "unique mixture" of the original Edwardian features and the 1936 renovation.

    <h3>Closure</h3>
    <p>
        The New Beehive Inn ceased trading in 2022 and was sold. The new owner replaced the original upper windows with uPVC in May and in June removed the bar from the tap room. 
        The oak-panelled bar dated to 1901 and featured mirror-backed oak shelving behind and an iron footrail. 
        In an attempt to protect the structure and interior the pub was granted statutory protection by Historic England as a grade II listed building on 13 July 2022. 
        At the time it was described by Historic England as "a rare survival of a late Victorian internal plan of four rooms centred around a drinking lobby" and "a rare example of a public house built by a local authority". 
        CAMRA described it as "Bradford’s last remaining public house to retain an interior of outstanding historic importance" and the City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council (successors to the Bradford Corporation) 
        said "It’s unique in the district as a public house built by Bradford Corporation and it still retains the original four room layout". 
        Because of the listing any significant alterations will require planning permission.
    </p>
    <p>
        In October 2022 the owners applied for planning permission to convert the building into offices, saying that as much of the internal features 
        as possible would be retained including some of the bell pushes, fireplaces and panelling. 
        An objection raised by CAMRA said that the proposal would lead to the loss of "one of the country's very best historic pub interiors". 
        The application was withdrawn in November 2022 though a revised application is expected.
