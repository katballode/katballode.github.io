<h1>Welcome to Page 5 of Kat Ballode's HTML Midterm!</h1>

<h1>Page 1</h1>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Error 1:</strong><p>I had to add !DOCTYPE html. This declares the type of HTML document being used, which in this case, is HTML5.</p></li>
    <li><strong>Error 2:</strong><p>I had to add html lang="en", as the language of the document was not defined.</p></li>
    <li><strong>Error 3:</strong><p> I had to add a head to the top of the page as well, above the metadata tags. They provide information to the browser and search engines about what the page's content is. </p></li>
    <li><strong>Error 4:</strong><p>I had to add meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE-edge" </p></li>
    <li><strong>Error 5:</strong><p>I added in meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0". This specifies the area of the screen used to display content. This gives it a 100% zoom and makes the line width the same as the page.</p></li>
    <li><strong>Error 6:</strong><p>The page title was Week 3 Assignment and not Page 1 </p></li>
    <li><strong>Error 7:</strong><p>The em tags around cr√®me fraiche were incorrect, one was just e, so I fixed that.</p></li>
    <li><strong>Error 8:</strong><p>In the series of paragraphs, one of them was not properly closed, so I closed it.</p></li>
  </ul>


<h1>Page 2</h1>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Error 1:</strong>The b tags around New Beehive Inn were wrong, so I corrected that.</li>
    <li><strong>Error 2:</strong>The b tags and h2 tags around Interior were reversed so I flipped them back. </li>
    <li><strong>Error 3:</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Error 4:</strong></li>
  </ul>


<h1>Page 3</h1>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Error 1:</strong><p>The li tag was actually l, which was incorrect. I corrected both sides of that tag.</p></li>
    <li><strong>Error 2:</strong><p>Fixed the endtag next to "Lily", it was lacking a td.</p></li>
    <li><strong>Error 3:</strong><p>Moved "Axelia" down between the tr tags.</p></li>
  </ul>


<h1>Page 4</h1>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Error 1:</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Error 2:</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Error 3:</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Error 4:</strong></li>
  </ul>
