    <strong>Telluride</strong> is the county seat and most populous town of San Miguel County in southwestern Colorado. The town was a former silver mining camp on the San Miguel River in the western San Juan Mountains. The first gold mining claim was made in the mountains above Telluride in 1875, leading to the early settlement of the town. It was founded in 1878 as "Columbia" but was renamed to "Telluride" in 1887 due to confusion with a California town of the same name. The town was named after the gold telluride minerals found in other parts of Colorado, despite these minerals never being found near Telluride. The area's mines provided zinc, lead, copper, silver, and other gold ores.

    Telluride is situated in a box canyon surrounded by steep forested mountains and cliffs. Bridal Veil Falls is located at the head of the canyon. There are numerous weathered ruins of old mining operations in the surrounding hillsides. A free gondola connects the town with its neighboring town, Mountain Village, Colorado at the base of the ski area. Telluride and its surrounding area have gained popularity in popular culture and are the subject of several songs. It is particularly known for its ski resort and slopes during the winter and its extensive festival schedule during the summer, including the Hot Air Balloon festival, which traditionally occurs the first weekend of June.

    The Telluride Historic District, which encompasses a significant portion of the town, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is one of Colorado's 20 National Historic Landmarks. The population of Telluride was 2,607 in the 2020 United States Census.

    Gold was first discovered in Colorado near present-day Denver, setting off the Pike's Peak gold rush of 1858. The Smuggler gold vein above Telluride and placer gold in the San Miguel River were discovered in 1875. John Fallon made the first claim in Marshal Basin above Telluride in 1875, leading to the early settlement of the town. Telluride was originally named "Columbia," but the name was changed by the post office in 1887 due to confusion with Columbia, California. The town was named after valuable ore compounds of the chemical element tellurium, a metalloid element that forms natural tellurides, including telluride ores of gold and silver. Despite the name, gold telluride minerals were never found in the mountains near Telluride,
 the area's mines were rich in zinc, lead, copper, silver, and ores which contained gold in other forms.

Telluride began slowly because of its isolated location. In 1881, a toll road was opened by Otto Mears, which allowed wagons to go where only pack mules could go before. This increased the number of people in Telluride, but it was still expensive to get gold-rich ore out of the valley.

In June 1889, Butch Cassidy, before becoming associated with his gang, the "Wild Bunch", robbed the San Miguel Valley Bank in Telluride. This was his first major recorded crime. He exited the bank with $24,580, and later became famous as a bank robber.[7]


<h2 id=“skiing-era”>Skiing Era</h2>
Mining was Telluride's only industry until 1972, when the first ski lift was installed by Telluride Ski Resort founder Joseph T. Zoline and his Telluride Ski Corporation (Telco). Zoline bought the land for the future resort in 1969 and began to craft the slopes. Along with his mountain manager, Telluride native Bill "Sr." Mahoney, they slowly and thoughtfully put together a plan for sustained development of Telluride and the region. As mining phased out and a new service industry phased in, the local population changed sharply. Mining families fled Telluride to settle in places like Moab, Utah, where uranium mining offered hope of continued employment. Mining families were replaced by what locals referred to as "hippies", young people with a 1960s worldview that often clashed with the values of Telluride's old-timers. These newcomers were characterized as idle "trustfunders" drawn to the town for a casual lifestyle and outdoor excitements such as hang gliding, mountain climbing, and kayaking.


<h2 id=“tourism”>Tourism</h2>
Beyond the ski lifts, Telluride is now widely recognized as an all-season resort. Telluride Ski Resort is the main attraction in the winter. But when summer comes around, Telluride transforms into an outdoor recreation hot spot, with tourists visiting to enjoy mountain biking, hiking, river rafting, sightseeing and more. The Telluride Tourism Board promotes tourism in the region.

Telluride features over 30 hiking trails ranging in difficulty level. Some of the hiking routes include Ajax Peak, Bear Creek Falls, Hope Lake, and Bridal Veil Falls. Hiking season begins in May and lasts until early October, with waterfalls gushing in June and wildflowers at their peak in early July. The trails range from quick and easy runs to multi-day hiking trips that reach an elevation of 14,000 feet (4,300 m). Nearly all the trails feature waterfalls, wildflowers, and high alpine lakes.[16]

Telluride is also home to many endurance events. The Imogene Pass Run from Ouray to Telluride, the Hardrock 100, held in July, has a major aid station in the town park. The Fall Tilt, a 12-hour downhill mountain biking event, is held in Mountain Village each September. And the 40 miles (64 km) Telluride Mountain Run loops the town in a wide swath that includes some of the most difficult and scenic trails in the area.
